metaDescription: Kudos Time Trial Series 2022, Rules
---

The intention of the series is to increase the number of participants in Manchester [CTT](https://cyclingtimetrials.org.uk/) events that aren't part of the Cheshire Series, most of which are rolling sporting courses, Team Time Trials and hill climbs.

+ To provide a level playing field for riders on road and time trial bikes in all groups.

+ To encourage younger riders to participate in Time Trials on road bikes which will help with their endurance for road racing.

+ To encourage Team planning for events to win the Overall team prize. There is no maximum number of riders for each Club/Team, each rider just has to ride a mnimum of 6 events to qualify for the prizes.

+ The series would run over the season as follows:

+ All non Cheshire Series solo events in the Manchester CTT calendar that don’t involve Chelford roundabout would be invited to join the new series, with the exception of TTTs.

*There is no maximum number of riders for each club/team, each rider just has to ride a minimum of 6 events to qualify for the prizes.*

**Points will be awarded to individual riders in the following categories, and on the following basis:**

+ Men TT bikes - Men road bikes

+ Women TT bikes - Women road bikes

+ (Under 18) Male Junior TT bikes - Male Junior road bikes

+ (Under 18) Female Junior TT bikes - Female Junior road bikes

+ (Under 16) Male Juvenile TT bikes - Male Juvenile road bikes

+ (Under 16) Female Juvenile TT bikes - Female Juvenile road bikes

+ Men Vets TT bikes - Men Vets road bikes

+ Women Vets TT bikes - Women Vets road bikes

### General rules for road bike entries

+ No *Tri-bars*, *clip-ons*, or aero-extensions to be used

+ Hands must be on the handlebars/brake hoods at all times, ie. no forearms resting on the bars

+ Maximum wheel depth, 65mm

+ No visors, no ear-covering crash hats, including the *Aerohead*

### Points

+ Riders will get points for each event they ride.

+ Riders can use either a TT bike or road bike, as appropriate for the event.

+ Veterans will be placed on standard.

*The series will be open to all riders, not just Manchester CTT riders.*

Points will be awarded in each category from 40 for 1st place to 1 for 40th. All riders receive a minimum 1 point.

After each qualifying event the individual riders points in each category will be tallied up and publish together with the Club/Team Standings.

To qualify for the overall team and individual standings, riders would need to enter a minimum of 6 events.

There is no maximum number of riders for each club/team, each rider just has to ride a mnimum of 6 events to qualify for the prizes.

There is no maximum number of counting events, so in effect riders could score points in every eligible event.

For TTT events points will be awarded in similar categories, so in the case of a 4-up team of 1 vet on a TT bike, 1 junior on a road bike, 1 senior male on a TT bike and 1 woman on a road bike, their time will become their solo times within their category and points awarded depending on their position within the category. Points would be awarded individually as a normal solo event, so from 40 points down.
